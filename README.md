# Coding Quiz
## Description
- Building a coding quiz was a great way to further test my knowledge on web API's and to review my skills on javascript. I decided to work a little on the css as well even though it was not required so that I could brush up on my skills and further visualize the containers for the javascript.
- This project was a challenge for me and I know that I would go about it an easier way when I refactor but I am happy that everything works as envisioned. The first challenge was to make the timer have a time penalty, but after working that out through using event listeners, the rest of the code fell into place. 
- To go through the game, you click a series of event listeners. When you click a wrong answer the current box turns red and time is deducted. When you click on the correct answer, the current question is removed and the next question function is called. This continues until the end of the game when the user is prompted for their name to save their high score.
- This is where I ran into my next big hurdle, saving the names and scores and logging them onto the High Score Page. After much fiddling, a youtube tutorial and help from a TA it finally all worked!
- In the future I plan on refactoring the code to work on if statements and switches so that the code is shorter and easier to manage.
- I learned so much on this project. As always I go in thinking 'this is way too big!' but once you get rolling on one problem, the next problem you need to tackle becomes clear. I guess you could say the biggest thing I learned this week is to 'trust the process' of breaking each problem down into smaller problems and working on each one at a time.
